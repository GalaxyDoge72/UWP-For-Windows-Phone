## UWP For Windows Phone ##
Documentation for Windows Phone compilatioon
This guide will only cover Windows Phone 10, simply because I do not have a Windows 8 phone.

## Step 1: Prerequisites ##
So you've stumbled across a Windows Phone, and decided to start development. I'm here to help.
Here's some things you'll need:
1. Visual Studio *2017* [https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/vs_community.exe] (Things like Visual Studio 2022 do not support working with UWP apps at a version of the SDK which we need.)
2. The Windows SDK (Windows Phone 10 only works with SDKs of a certain version.)
3. A physical device to work with. (I have a Lumia 650 and there *is* an emulator for Windows Phone, but I haven't gotten it to work.)
